4,13717574,Traffic or Street Sign Issue,"Parents frequently are  ignore the sign for limited access   on the small access road off of Poppy to mostly pickup their kids  and drop off  from Day Care. There is an obvious sign that the driveway  which is also used for Garbage access  is only to be used for official purposes - not for child pickup/drop off.  My understanding is that Monte Sereno still gets ""a vote"" on traffic flow around the school. The school appears to be ignoring the restrictions set on the small access road and I feel this is a safety issue for walkers on the sidewalk as the visibility from an exiting car is probably limited and this is combined with parents that are anxious to get home.   If a sign is posted for official use only no parent pickup or drop off should be allowed or the Poppy traffic flow needs to be reconsidered. My sense is the school is looking the other way and doesnt want to be bothered enforcing the limited access  restrictions which are posted. The only possible solution maybe a limited access controlled gate as so many feel that the restrictions do not apply to themselves and only their own convenience matters - not safety.
