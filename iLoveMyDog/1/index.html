            <p>Hello Friends, I am the proud owner of Mayo the dog.
                She is a German Shepherd. I will show off some photos
                of my dog and ask you about your own dog! Ran strings of words
                so I can make this paragraph look longer
                so that it is harder to make it look good within a website and
                i have to challenge myself. Anyway, I love my dog because she
                is very cute and very loyal. I also love her very much because
                she is my best friend in the world. Honestly, I can live in the
                woods alone with Mayo for a year...with the occasionally visit 
                from Christine, of course. Ok. I think this is enough words...Iguess
                I am padding the content ;) hehehe dasdasdasd
